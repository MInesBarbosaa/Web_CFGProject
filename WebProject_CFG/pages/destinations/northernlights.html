              The northern lights (Aurora borealis) aren't exactly a place on
              Earth. They are a naturally occurring atmospheric phenomenon that
              can happen in many places around the Northern hemisphere, between
              60 and 75 degrees of latitude. They are an dancing frenzy between
              the goodess of dawn, Aurora, and Boreas, the northern wind.
              There´s a corresponding phenomenon in the South hemisphere, the
              Aurora australis. As I live between 37 and 42 degrees of latitude,
              Auroras are one of my dream destinations.
            </p>
            <p>
              But what are Auroras after all? When a solar storm comes towards
              Earth some of the energy and small particles can travel down the
              magnetic field lines at the north and south poles into Earth's
              atmosphere. There, the particles interact with gases in our
              atmosphere resulting in beautiful displays of light in the sky -
              Auroras. Oxygen gives off green and red light. Nasa clearly
              explains this stuning phenomenon using didatic films that you can
              watch
