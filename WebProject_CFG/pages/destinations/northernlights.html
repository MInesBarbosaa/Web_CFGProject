    <h1>Northern Lights</h1>
    <p>
      The northern lights (aurora borealis) aren't exactly a place on earth.
      They are a naturally occurring atmospheric phenomenon that can happen in
      many places around the globe. As I live in the South, aurora borealis are
      one of my dream destinations.
